# Changelog

All notable public releases of Ask the Model are recorded here.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-09-19

Application-scope and documentation correction.

### Included

- clarified AtM as a local conversational access layer for scientific model repositories;
- explicitly documented EWD, CBD and RMD as the initial repository suite;
- added canonical application-boundary documentation in `STATUS.md`;
- added citation metadata in `CITATION.cff`;
- added standardized repository identity and release documentation;
- aligned desktop and AppStream metadata with the application's actual purpose.

### Application status

This release does not add AI chat functionality. It corrects and formalizes the application's documented purpose, repository relationship and metadata.

AtM does not contain, redefine or replace EWD, CBD, RMD or other scientific models. Each model remains canonical in its own repository.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-19

Initial application baseline.

### Included

- GTK 4 and Granite 7 application shell;
- stable application ID `io.github.laurentiustaicu.ask_the_model`;
- Meson build and installation configuration;
- freedesktop desktop launcher metadata;
- AppStream application metadata;
- elementary-compatible application icon sizes;
- standardized Ask the Model project identity and MIT licensing.

### Application status

This release establishes the native application shell and desktop integration baseline.

AI chat functionality, local model-provider integration, conversation management,
settings, and other end-user features are not yet implemented.

### Scope boundary

Ask the Model is an application interface. It does not contain or constitute an
AI model itself.
